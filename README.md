# George the robot

This is the final project for the subject Digital Logic 2 in semester 5 in University of Alexandria Faculty of Engineering Computer and Communications major.

The project definitely could be refined better especially as we learnt more throughout the years.

George is a joke we had going in the team, so it felt fitting to name our robot George.

It is one of the hardest projects we had to do, because we had zero prior knowledge of ESP32, Arduino IDE, or anything.

I hope the documentation is satisfactory!!
