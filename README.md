# George the robot

This is the final project for the subject Digital Logic 2 in semester 5 in University of Alexandria Faculty of Engineering Computer and Communications major.

The project definitely could be refined better especially as we learnt more throughout the years.

George is a joke we had going in the team, so it felt fitting to name our robot George.

It is one of the hardest projects we had to do, because we had zero prior knowledge of ESP32, Arduino IDE, or anything.

I hope the documentation is satisfactory!!

## Materials Used

- Robot platform 4WD: the robot body in black
  
- 4 Wheels: 4 wheels came with the platforms
  
- 4 DC 10A PWM Motor Controllers: motor for each wheel
  
- 2 Cytron SHIELD-MD10 DC Motor Driver Shields: 1 motor driver for the front 2 wheels and 1 for the back 2 wheels
  
- 2 ESP 32-S: one was used for all the main functions and one was used to connect to wifi
  
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Detector: gave the robot "eyes" and was used to measure distance to the lcd screen
  
- Character LCD Green 2×16 with Serial interface IIC/I2C Module: was used for the ultrasonic sensor, the smoke detector, or just to display a cute message
  
- Serial I2C LCD Daughter Board Module: used with the lcd screen
  
- MQ-2 Smoke Sensor Module: simple smoke detector
  
- AA Batteries and Battery holders: to power the entire robot
  
- 2 SG92R Micro Servo 180 Degree: we moved around the ultrasonic detector in all directions using a specific holder
